# Mini-Development-Projects
I have 2 mini projects in game by using C.
That is Stone-paper-scissors and Tic-Tac-Toe.
## In Stone paper scissors, Player has to play with AI.
In this game, the player will select either rock,paper,or scissors and the computer will randomly select one of these options as well.
The program will then compare the choices and determine the winner based on the rules:"Rock beats scissors,Scissors beats paper and Paper beats rock".
## In Tic-Tac-Toe, Two players have to play a game.
In this game,Two player game where each player takes turns placing X or O on a 3*3 grid until one player gets three in a row,either horizontally,vertically,or diagonally.
If neither player succeeds in achieving this, the game is declared a draw.
